## wordopt-count-get-py
In this code, I get the .txt file base.txt (590 lines of data) and,
1. Find the most occuring word in three different coding styles including the most optimized way i.e. using only 2 lines of code with get() method in dictionary.
2. The frequency of occurance of that particular word.

Uncomment to run specific coding styles - conditional if-else, .get() in two styles.

Ignore the print statements in between used for debug.
